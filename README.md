### Homework 1 (08.09 - 22.09):
1. (4 points) Heapsort (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort).
2. (2 points) Maximum sum on paths from a root to leaves in a binary tree.
3. (2 points) Generalized method for top-down tree traversal.
4. (4 points) The Peano arithmetic (+, -, *, ^) in an object-oriented manner.

### Homework 2 (15.09 - 29.09):
1. (4 points) Previous homework using Unit tests and Gradle.
2. (4 points) The computer network assignment from the spring term.

### Homework 3 (22.09 - 06.10):
1. (4 points) An AVL tree class (insertion, deletion, search). A pretty printer, which output reflects a tree structure.
 A lot of unit tests.

### Homework 4 (29.09 - 13.10):
1. (4 points) An set interface class (insertion, deletion, search, union, intersection). Two implementations of this

In this homework you can use whatever you want for organizing concurrency.

1. (2 points) A parallel increment without synchronization.
2. (3 points) A parallel mergesort.
